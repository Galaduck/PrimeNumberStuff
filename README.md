### Prime Grouping Definitions
Twin Primes: Two primes that differ by 2. ex. <br/>
Prime Triplet: A group of 3 primes where the smallest and largest primes differ by 6.<br/>
Prime Quadruplet: A set of 4 primes, (p, p+2, p+6, p+8)<br/>
Prime Quintuplet: A set of 5 primes that contains 2 twin primes, 3 overlapping prime triplets, and a prime quadruplet.<br/>
Prime Sextuplet: A set of 6 primes that contains 2 twin primes, 4 overlapping prime triplets, a prime quadruplet, and 2 overlapping 
prime quintuplets.

##Prining
Prining is a term coined by me (as far as i know): It is a simple process that most people probably do, but it involves creating a list of numbers and then checking them for primality. I used to just use a random number generator to do this. That form of prining is called "True Prining".

All the primes in the document were found through using for loops to create a list of commands and them running them. These primes may exist somewhere on the internet, but i dont really know about that.
